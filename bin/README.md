## JSON loader for the BTT

Loads jsons from current (and nested) directories and tries to load them to BTT.

### Installation

Clone the repo, install the package globally 
`$ npm install -g`

### Usage

Make sure BTT is running and you're using at least version 2.500

Run: 
`$ btt-json-loader` 

A lot of dialogs may pop-up, depending on the amount of JSONs in the current working directory.

Just confirm that you want to load this preset and viola!
